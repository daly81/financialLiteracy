SSL Certificates: Use the free "let's encrypt" service. This is handled automatically by a cron job that runs
every 12 hours to see if the certificates need to be renewed, which is the rate certbot recommends.

----------------

Web Server: An apache httpd server hosts sevengenerationsfinanacial.com from /www/sevengenerationsfinancial.com/.
It is hosted on port 3000 locally only.

NGINX is used to forward ports for various domains and managed SSL encryption. This way apache
httpd doesn't need to be configured for SSL (which is more complicated) AND, much more nicely, you
can run different kinds of servers like a node server. You would just have to host it on port
locally (like 3001) make an nginx config file (duplicate one from /www/nginx as a template) and
generate a certbot certificate.

-----------------

PHP: Has a number of modules that just came with MAMP/WAMP but here have to be installed manually
in order to use them. Thing like PDO and json_encode are modules. I've already installed those two
but if you need to install one you can find them with the 'pacs' tool by searching for php. You'll
know if you're missing a module if a function you think should exist (like json_encode) comes up
as unknown.
